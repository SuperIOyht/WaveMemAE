# Wavelet Based Memory Autoencoder for Noncontact Fingerprint Presentation Attack Detection
this is official implementation of WaveMemAE model
## abstract
ingerprint presentation attack detection (FPAD) is essential in fingerprint identification systems. Noncontact
methods such as fingerprint biometrics are becoming popular because they are not affected by skin conditions and there are no hygiene issues. However, most of the existing noncontact FPAD methods are supervised methods with poor generalizability and poor performance in the face of attacks such as unseen presentation attacks (PAs). Moreover, easily overlooked frequency domain information contributes to the fingerprint antispoofing task. Therefore, we propose a wavelet-based memory-augmented autoencoder that fully utilizes the frequency domain information. Specifically, the model first decomposes the input image into high and low-frequency information and extracts features separately. Subsequently, we propose a frequency complementary connection (FCC) module to realize the fusion and complementation of
frequency domain information at the feature level. Moreover, a memory distance expansion loss is proposed to keep the
memory module diverse. Experiments were conducted to verify the effectiveness of the method.
